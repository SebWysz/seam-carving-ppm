# CS-128 : MP : Seam Carver

This program takes in a ppm image and carves out horizonal and/or vertical seams of lowest energy. 
This allows the image to remain full of detail while taking out pixels that aren't as "interesting."  

For visual reference, go to images, then see the difference in ocean.ppm and ocean-carved.ppm after 50 horizontal and 170 vertical seam carves.
